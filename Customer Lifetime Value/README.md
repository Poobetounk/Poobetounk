Customer lifetime value (CLV) is the overall value that a customer brings to a business throughout the entire duration of their association with the brand. Instead of focusing solely on the value of separate transactions, this metric considers the complete range of potential transactions that could occur over the course of the customer's engagement with the company. It quantifies the total revenue generated from that customer over their entire relationship with the business.
