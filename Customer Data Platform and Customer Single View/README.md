A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a tool that collects and combines customer data from different places like websites, apps, social media, and more. Its goal is to create a complete and organized view of each customer. This helps businesses understand their customers better â€“ what they like, how they behave, and how they interact with the company through various channels.


Customer Single View (CSV) is a way for companies to gather and put together all the important information they have about a customer. This includes details about the customer, their past interactions with the company, and their activities across different communication channels like email, phone, or social media. The goal is to create a complete and up-to-date picture of the customer and how they engage with the company. This helps businesses better understand their customers, offer personalized experiences, and make smarter decisions to improve customer satisfaction.
